- "Runtime Unreachable: ..."
- - Use the bigint project, see if we can build & invoke query module
- - create-type might be the reason here?
- - W3Invoke might be the reason?
- - Memory might be the reason?

- Get rid of w3Invoke?
- use the toml editor to manually set the crate-type of query when it's being used by mutation
- Remove all docker files from the APIs
- don't require rust-version in web3api.build.yaml, should be defaulted
